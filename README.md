A site generation tool very much inspired by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using some of my (current) favorite things

* [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) ([in java](https://github.com/samskivert/jmustache)) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) ([in java](http://code.google.com/p/markdownj/)) for the generation of HTML.
* [GSON](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) for handling configuration
